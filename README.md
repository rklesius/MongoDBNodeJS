## How to Run

The tutorial is broken down into different folders and is designed so that you can run each folder individually.  Clone the repository and then open the command line in the desired folder.  Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies and create your node_modules folder.  Then run `node Grades.js` to run the code.  

Some folders will serve on http://localhost:8080/
