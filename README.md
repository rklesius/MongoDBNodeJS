## How to Run

In order to run this code you need [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed and in your path.  

The tutorial is broken down into different folders and is designed so that you can run each folder individually.  Clone the repository and then open the command line in the desired folder.  Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies and create your node_modules folder.  Then run `node server.js` to run the code.  

All folders except ConnectionTest will serve on http://localhost:8080/
